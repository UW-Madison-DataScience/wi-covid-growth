## Summary


#### This week (5/5/2020)

All Wisconsin metropolitan areas are still seeing growth of COVID-19 confirmed cases.  Average daily change is slower in Madison, and Fond du Lac (around 1\% growth), but still moderately high in Green Bay (8.4\%), Janesville-Beloit (8.2\%), Appleton (7.2\%), and Racine (7.1\%).  Some of these areas are seeing increasing growth rates, which may indicate further spread or an increase in the number of tests for COVID-19 being performed.  In terms of the extent of COVID-19, the Green Bay metro area has over 4 cases per thousand residents as of May 3rd, which is by far the highest in Wisconsin.  This comes after several weeks of high growth.  Milwaukee still ranks second-highest in terms of confirmed cases per capita at around 2.4 per thousand but is growing slower than areas like Green Bay, Racine, and Janesville-Beloit.  If trends continue in those areas, Racine and Janesville-Beloit metropolitan areas may surpass Milwaukee in confirmed cases per thousand in the coming weeks.  While the outbreak is still early in Appleton, growth rates are increasing there, and this area should be monitored closely.  

#### Last week (4/22/2020)

Looking at daily growth rates of confirmed cases, the Green Bay metro area far outpaces any other Wisconsin metro area.  Confirmed cases in Green Bay are growing around 17-20% each day and confirmed cases have increased from 105 cases on April 14 to 327 on April 21.  Green Bay has about 1 confirmed case per thousand residents, which is the second-highest in Wisconsin metro areas (Milwaukee is the highest at 1.7 confirmed cases per thousand).  All other Wisconsin metro areas are showing daily growth rates between 0% and 5%.  Oshkosh-Neenah, Racine, and Janesville-Beloit are on the higher end of that range, with growth rates between 4.5% and 5.0% each day.  Racine now has the third-highest confirmed cases per thousand, around 0.94.  Madison recently saw a small uptick in growth rate, with 18 new cases from April 21 to April 22 (compared to less than 10 in previous days), but this may be tied to an increase in testing across the state (which can be seen on the [Wisconsin DHS website](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data.htm#laboratory-testing-capacity))  

<!-- #### Last week (4/16/2020) -->

<!-- Current daily growth rates of confirmed cases in Wisconsin metro areas range between 1.5% and 14%. Many metro areas (Milwaukee, Madison, Fond du Lac, Sheboygan, Appleton, Eau Claire) are seeing a slow decline in growth rates, but in all of those areas, confirmed cases are still growing.  Green Bay and Racine are among the highest growth rate metro areas with 13.6% growth and 10.8% growth, respectively, on 4/14.  More concerning is that these growth rates have been stable over the last week and not decreasing as many of the other metro areas have been.  Milwaukee has 1.4 confirmed cases per thousand residents, highest among Wisconsin metro areas.  Racine now has the second-highest confirmed cases per thousand residents at 0.68.   -->

<!-- #### Last Week (4/8/2020) -->

<!-- Daily growth rates of confirmed cases offer a look at the future growth of the disease and can help measure whether a metropolitan area is "flattening the curve".  Among Wisconsin metro areas with at least 30 cases, Madison has the lowest growth rates of confirmed cases (6-7\% since April 4th).  Most other Wisconsin metro areas range between 9\% and 15\% growth, signaling a reduction from the mid-March growth rates which ranged between 30\% and 80\% for Madison and Milwaukee.  Green Bay recently reached 30 confirmed cases, but their early growth rate is much higher than others in Wisconsin.  Looking at the extent of the pandemic in terms of confirmed cases per thousand, Wisconsin metro areas are faring much better than epicenters like New York (8 cases per thousand) and New Orleans (7.8 cases per thousand).  The highest in Wisconsin is Milwaukee with less than 1 case per thousand.  However, the epicenters are further along in pandemic, and as long as growth rates remain positive, the situation will continue to worsen.   -->



Note: We first observed the visualizations here in the New York Times's the article [Four Ways to Measure Coronavirus Outbreaks in U.S. Metro Areas](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/upshot/coronavirus-new-york-comparison.html), which has a follow-up article [Coronavirus in the U.S.: How Fast It’s Growing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-metro-area-tracker.html) that has been updated daily.  This document adds in less populated Wisconsin metropolitan areas and highlights them against metropolitan areas across the U.S. and the world.  Much of the text explanations below draw from both articles.



## Daily Growth Rate

To assess the possible future of the outbreak, it’s helpful to look not just at the number of cases but also at how quickly they are increasing. The accompanying chart shows the growth rate of cumulative cases over time, averaged over the previous week.

*This plot is interactive*: Double click on a region in the legend to start a comparison and then single click on others to add or remove them from the comparison.  Note: double clicking may not work well on all platforms, but you may single click on a region in the legend to remove from comparison.  

Here, we can see whether the trajectory of a local epidemic is getting better or worse. A growth rate of 40 percent on this chart means the cumulative number of cases is growing by 40 percent every day. A rate of 100 percent would mean that the number of cases was doubling daily.  Any growth rate above 0 percent means that there are still new daily cases.

**Pros of this measure**: Growth rates help us judge whether the epidemic is getting better or worse in a given place right now.

**Cons**: The timing of different outbreaks can make comparisons difficult. Case data quality varies a lot by place.


## Growth Rates by Case Count

The chart below shows the growth rate by the number of cases or deaths in a given metropolitan area.  In this chart, the goal for each region is to reach 0 percent daily change (y-axis) as fast as possible, before the confirmed cases per thousand (x-axis) get too large.  As long as the daily change in cases is above zero, the region will continue to see an increase in confirmed cases, and the line will continue to move to the right.  High growth rates combined with a lot of confirmed cases are a bad combination and may cause health systems to be overwhelmed.

This measurement shows whether a community has succeeded in slowing the rate of growth before there are many cases. In other words, it shows whether a community is succeeding at flattening the curve.

```


**Pros of this measure**: Helps distinguish between places where cases are growing fast with few cases and places where cases are numerous and still growing fast.

**Cons**: Hard to read at first. Relies on case data.

**Pros of this measure:** Coronavirus deaths are much more likely to be accurately counted than total cases.

**Cons:** Death rates depend on the underlying health and age of various communities. They also lag infections by several weeks, so they don’t tell us what’s happening now.

Calculate "Average Daily Change in Total Cases, Over the Previous 7 Days" at time $t$ as

$$
\textrm{avg daily change}_t =  \left( \frac{\textrm{cases}_t}{\textrm{cases}_{t-7}} \right)^{(1/7)} - 1 
$$

which is a compound daily growth rate (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate>).
